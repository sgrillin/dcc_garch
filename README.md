## ðŸ§­ Overview

The `dcc_garch` package implements the **Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC)** framework proposed by **Engle (2002)** â€” a cornerstone in multivariate volatility modeling.  
It estimates time-varying covariance and correlation matrices by combining univariate GARCH-type models with a dynamic correlation structure.

This implementation is designed for **clarity, extensibility, and research replication**.  
It supports **Gaussian** and **Studentâ€“t** innovations, **asymmetric correlation** (ADCC), and a variety of univariate volatility and mean specifications including **ARMA**, **ARIMA**, **GJRâ€“GARCH**, and **EGARCH**.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Univariate step (Stage 1):**
  - Constant, **ARMA(p,q)**, or **ARIMA(p,d,q)** mean structures  
  - **GARCH(1,1)**, **GJRâ€“GARCH**, and **EGARCH** volatility dynamics  
  - Gaussian or Studentâ€“t quasiâ€“maximum likelihood (QMLE)  

- **Multivariate step (Stage 2):**
  - **DCC(1,1)** and **ADCC(1,1)** correlation dynamics  
  - Estimation via **L-BFGS-B** optimization with ridge stabilization  
  - Full log-likelihood under Gaussian or Studentâ€“t distributions  

- **Advanced options:**
  - Rolling and expanding window estimation (`RollingDCC`)  
  - Parameter inference with robust (sandwich) standard errors  
  - Forecasts of conditional covariance and correlation matrices  
  - Modular class design (`UGARCH`, `DCC`, `RollingDCC`)
